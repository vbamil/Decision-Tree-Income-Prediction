# Decision-Tree-Income-Prediction

In this project, we will build a decision tree to predict the income of a given population, which is labelled as <=50K. The attributes (predictors) are age, working class type, marital status, gender, race etc.

In the following sections, we'll:

clean and prepare the data,
build a decision tree with default hyperparameters,
understand all the hyperparameters that we can tune, and finally
choose the optimal hyperparameters using grid search cross-validation.
